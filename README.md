# Autonomous-Vehicles-Projects

Course projects from studies in Autonomous vehicles including the Udacity Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

These are the projects that I have completed while learning to enginner autonomous driving systems, mainly from the
Udacity Nanodegree, but with some additional side study.
Some of the Udacity labs have been edited for readability after I completed them, as the originals have some quite 
lengthy comments by the designers of the labs.
